# Adversarial Images improves Image Recognition
Adversarial examples are commonly viewed as a threat
to ConvNets. Here we present an opposite perspective: adversarial examples can be used to improve image recognition models. We propose an enhanced adversarial training scheme **AdvProp**.
We used ImageNet-A[https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/natural-adversarial-examples-imageneta] as our dataset which is composed of nearly 7500 images.
